            Hello W3 worms. What a waste of time, this W3. BBS is better and more lively and this is only a fad... but Net-Ex wanted me
            to post here so here it is: <br /><br />
            I don't expect any of you dumb fucks to understand any of this but here's a bit of the program I'm writing for the tape to dat
            conversion. If you have any clue what any of it means (which you probably dont) then feel free to send some critique to my BBS
            at 343-321-8875 so I can reply and tell you how wrong and stupid you are:<br /><br />

            Just finished setting up the website! Apologies to those that were here before and just saw the plain old .txt file!
            I didn't think that this site would get so many hits (67!) in so little time, but I guess that's the nature of the 90s.
            <br /><br />
            I also set up KR3ML1N with an account and he'll post a few snippets of details here and there but don't expect much exposition
            from him... that's my spiel (German for play)!

            [13:22 | 10/13/1991] News of some Swimdog Leaks
        </div>

            Hey everyone, Net-xplorer here<br /><br />
            I just heard some news that Swimdog Co. was hacked and a bunch of confidential emails, recordings,
            and what have you was just leaked onto the net! Well, leaked onto the BBS (bulletin board system) network, that is.
            So I thought I'd create this website to host the leaks as I get them for those of you on the W3 network (you know, any page
            you go to that starts with WWW and uses the HTTP protocol). I know my Dad is a big info-leak buff and he can't figure
            out the BBS stuff so he's really gonna love this! <br /><br />
            Anyway onto the leak: As for authenticity I can assure you that it is the real deal! My hacker buddy (I'm not a hacker for the record - I am
            just an HTML programmer who has an interest in the 'dark' stuff of the internet) got a data package from a friend of his
            and booted it up on his computer - and what I saw would make your jaw drop!<br /><br />
            The files my buddy had was all on cassette tapes that were read into a C64 (Commodore 64 - an old-ish computer from a few years back) so
            I have to do all the data copying by hand for now. My hacker buddy, who goes by KR3ML1N on the net, is writing a program to
            automatically convert the tape data to ASCII files and says he'll be done soon so hopefully I can mass post all the leaks in a bit. <br /><br />
            Anyway, I'll begin writing up the first email tonight before I head to bed.<br /><br />
            Buckle up folks, you're in for one HECKUVA ride!
